To process a patient:

    1. Open Corview Project
        a. Export VTK with all smoothing stuff as "endo.vtk" in working/id directory
        b. Segment the CS (figure 1)
        c. Assign 10 landmarks along the CS (from the top down) (figure 2)
        d. Export landmarks as "mri.csv"
        e. Import both fluoro images
        f. For each fluoro image:
            a. Create mask layer to hold landmarks
            b. Go to Regions tab and assign 10 landmarks along the CS catheter starting from the tip (figure 3)
            c. Make sure to use the first slice, slice 1!
            d. Export landmarks as "f1.csv", "f2.csv"
    2. Convert corview landmark files for Matlab
        a. sed -ibak 's/ /,/g'  f1.csv
        b. sed -ibak 's/ /,/g'  f2.csv
        c. sed -ibak 's/ /,/g'  mri.csv
    3. Open Matlab
        a. ???
    4. Run dynaview
        a. dynaview mri.vtk S.csv lmX13D.csv zmr.csv f1.dcm f2.dcm MX1.csv MX2.csv lmMR.csv MPRo.csv lmX23D.csv lmX.csv
        b. Export image from above
        c. Export image parallel projection centered on fluoro 1
        d. Export image parallel projection centered on fluoro 2
